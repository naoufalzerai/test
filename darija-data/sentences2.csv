"Perhaps there is a signal here.",""
"Have yo got you",""
"Have you got your phone with you?",""
"I'm not going to calm down!",""
"I have a conference call with the Tokyo office in less than 15 minutes.",""
"I can't miss it.",""
"The box depends on it.",""
"Your salary depends on it.",""
"Call for help!",""
"There's the big red button!",""
"In the name of God!",""
"Why is it my fault?",""
"If you paid me more I would press more buttons for help",""
"What if I sing you a song to calm you down?",""
"Right, I've pressed the big red button and nothing has happened.",""
"Well, my phone doesn't work in the damn metal box!",""
"You need to get a better phone",""
"No, you're not going to sing!",""
"I hate singers!",""
"My ex-husband was a singer.",""
"He used to sing all the time.",""
"We could never concentrate at home.",""
"Or sleep.",""
"He even sang in his sleep.",""
"I don't know why I'm telling you this.",""
"Get us out of here!",""
"OK OK.",""
"It is moving now and here is floor two.",""
"You will get to your meeting on time, but not with me.",""
"I've had enough of you.",""
"I quit!",""
"Hello Sami, how are you today?",""
"How is your arthritis?",""
"The weather is so good, I hope it's not too bad!",""
"Ah, hello, I'm glad to see you, it's been so long!",""
"Unfortunately, the moisture is playing tricks on me, and my arthritis makes me suffer terribly.",""
"I am so sorry to hear that!",""
"Hopefully it will go away soon",""
"That's sweet, but you know what it's like at my age...",""
"You'll never guess who I ran into at the church sale last Saturday - Simon!",""
"He reminded me of that party we had last year, how lovely it was to sit outside then",""
"Yes, we're all no spring chickens anymore",""
"Dear Simon, how has he been all this time?",""
"Did he finally take the time to sign up for the Amicale?",""
"He seems to be doing well, though you know what happened with his wife last year, he's being very brave",""
"I haven't heard about the plans for the Amicale?!",""
"How unfortunate!",""
"I think he should have been in the dating seminars for retired kids while he's still green.",""
"But maybe you should also sign up for these activities?",""
"Hahaha, I don't need seminars to teach me!",""
"But I'm sorry, I'm going to have to leave you",""
"I must get home in time to prepare lunch or I'll get those fainting spells again",""
"But it's been lovely to see you!",""
"You must come visit me soon",""
"It was good to see you too!",""
"I hope I can come and see you soon.",""
"And I hope you get a respite from the arthritis!",""
"Ugh I'm fed up of nature.",""
"All it does is give me a blocked nose and insect bites.",""
"If you like nature it's hard to escape insect bites.",""
"But why the clogged nose, you're allergic to something: Flowers, trees...?",""
"I don't know.",""
"I appear to be allergic to most things these days.",""
"But nature just seems to keep following me everywhere!",""
"We'd have to do a desensitization test.",""
"Maybe you're allergic to animal hairs, too.",""
"But this doesn't tell us where we are.",""
"Do you have any idea where to go?",""
"No idea whatsoever.",""
"Just get us anywhere it doesn't itch anymore!",""
"We could try to find a pond, but I bet we'd get eaten alive by mosquitos.",""
"No, I don't think we should aim at the pond.",""
"We'd have to get out of the forest quickly.",""
"Why don't we scream?",""
"Or maybe we could just get back to ourselves?",""
"Do you have a loud voice?",""
"Or a megaphone that could help us?",""
"Yes, I could use my beautiful voice.",""
"I didn't think to take my megaphone.",""
"Sorry.",""
"I have a lot of water, though.",""
"Do you have your phone with you?",""
"Let's try Google Maps?",""
"Please let's not.",""
"I'm idealogically opposed to Google and any other institute trying to use us to get more data!",""
"We could just wander aimlessly and hope we find our way back.",""
"I have a vacuum cleaner that uses that very technique to clean the flat!",""
"You want us to straddle by snorting the ground?",""
"No, it's a joke.",""
"We should never have left the roads.",""
"Besides, I think that's what triggers an allergic reaction.",""
"Or these are the six little pistachio macaroons you took from the snack bar.",""
"What?",""
"You saw me take them?",""
"I thought I was being subtle...",""
"No, I saw the whole thing.",""
"Do you know how to direct yourself by the position of the sun?",""
"Not me.",""
"I may still pull out my phone and use Google, but if I've understood this is going to start a new allergy attack.!",""
"Ok, ok.",""
"You can use Google Maps...",""
"This is not good timing!",""
"An elevator failure is never the time!",""
"Let's flip the alarm.",""
"No don’t do that.",""
"I’d actually rather present my pitch directly to you.",""
"Really?",""
"What do you want us to do?",""
"Even if it's a bad time, it better be the elevator that goes down!",""
"Yes.",""
"I was going to suggest that you retired immediately.",""
"Please don’t take this the wrong way.",""
"I'm not taking this the wrong way, but I don't know how to pull out of an elevator down.",""
"You make and design elevators but this one breaks every day.",""
"It’s a disgrace.",""
"Our office is on the four hundredth floor and I have to take the stairs every day.",""
"That.",""
"That's no reason not to flip the alarm!",""
"I just thought you’d like the chance to defend yourself before going before the board of governors.",""
"Is it getting hot in here?",""
"I think you're very aggressive.",""
"Let's try to find a solution.",""
"Or do you want to take advantage of the situation to have a good time together and without aggression?",""
"What sort of good time did you have in mind?",""
"I have always had a thing for people in authority.",""
"Uh... it depends on you...",""
"I’m very open minded.",""
"Open-minded, perhaps, but in a very confined space.",""
"I'd prefer a stubborn spirit in an open space.",""
"An alcoholic spirit?",""
"Perhaps we could get a drink together?",""
"Well, I feel like there's a bar in the elevator.",""
"Oh yes, there is.",""
"Let’s get plastered.",""
"I don't know how we're gonna get out and the elevator and this dialogue that I prefer to end.",""
"Good luck with the meeting.",""
"That's it.",""
"The elevator's down again.",""
"I think you should, as a boss, do something to make these blackouts stop!",""
"I’m afraid there’s very little I can do.",""
"I’ve spoken to the council, but they just blame the weather.",""
"The masters, always the same.",""
"I don't think it's a matter of time.",""
"More money, don't you think?",""
"The system is so antiquated.",""
"It can’t cope with the heat.",""
"It would cost millions.",""
"That's just it.",""
"If the system is old and outdated, it's security issues for your employees, right?",""
"It deserves to spend millions of dollars to protect us.",""
"We are just a small business.",""
"I have very little leverage.",""
"Perhaps you could take a pay cut to help pay?",""
"Oh, my God, you're really something.",""
"It's up to us to pay for the repairs with our salaries!",""
"Amazing.",""
"You should start screaming with me to call 911.",""
"Calm down.",""
"All I’m asking for is half of your salary for the next twenty years.",""
"Otherwise you’ll have to use the stairs.",""
"No problem.",""
"I don't see any drawbacks to use the stairs.",""
"But you're gonna have to do the same, you guys, do the same thing.",""
"You look like you could do with using the stairs a bit more.",""
"I have many lazy employees.",""
"It's possible.",""
"There are also many of our leaders who are fat and skinny on borrowed stairs!",""
"I once won Mr Universe, I’ll have you know.",""
"I’m an adonis.",""
"Modest and proud of it, obviously.",""
"Ah, that's it.",""
"The door opens.",""
"Goodbye, you cheap bastard!",""
"Let's see if they prefer white or brown bread.",""
"Oh you took both?",""
"Great.",""
"I suggest we give this group some white, and brown to this other group.",""
"I heard that the bread was bad for the ducks.",""
"Now we can compare the efficiency of white bread and the black bread on these ducks.",""
"This is gonna be interesting.",""
"Yes, that is a conspiracy spread by firms that produce crackers and biscuits.",""
"They want to feed the ducks with crackers and cookies?",""
"It's stupid, it's too fat and too salty.",""
"And a lot of conservatives.",""
"At least the bread is healthy!",""
"It is empty calories, which makes the ducks fat and more likely to sink.",""
"It could make a lot of fat, though.",""
"Anyway, they seem to like two types of bread.",""
"Yes maybe some kale and broccoli would be better for them.",""
"Here, the little ducklings are coming in single file!",""
"I'm not even sure I know what the ducks are eating.",""
"Early in the season all of the mating pairs still have lots of ducklings.",""
"Yeah, it's kind of cute.",""
"I'm a little disappointed, at the moment they seem to digest the bread perfectly.",""
"The main challenge in feeding ducks lies in throwing the bread to different places so that even the smaller ducks get some too.",""
"Absolutely.",""
"But even among adults there seems to be dominant and dominant.",""
"Look at this one, every time he goes for the piece of bread to steal from his rightful recipient.",""
"Are we allowed to fish here?",""
"There's a fisherman there.",""
"Yes, the more aggressive ducks get more food and are better able to dominate the others.",""
"There are fishermen wading in the river as well but they need to watch out for snapping turtles.",""
"Are there turtles?",""
"I like turtles a lot!",""
"And swans are very aggressive this time of year.",""
"Everyone likes turtles!",""
"I hope so.",""
"I like their little alien heads and their wet skin of old men!",""
"The pigeons also come later and eat the bread crumbs that are dropped on the river bank.",""
"When I was little, I hated my cousin, in the country, who sometimes put turtles on her back.",""
"I thought it was totally mean and free.",""
"And I put them on their feet each time.",""
"And of course the hawks come for the pigeons.",""
"Yeah, it's the food chain.",""
"However, I doubt that the hawks are interested in turtles.",""
"Sometimes they are lucky and get a small dog or cat instead.",""
"That's for the day of the party!",""
"Well, the ducks are still here.",""
"They want more bread.",""
"Is there any left?",""
"Ducks are very patient creatures.",""
"Of course",""
"We throw them all that's left?",""
"There are always some crumbs at the bottom of the bag.",""
"I'm really tired today... so I say we stay by the pool!",""
"Oh come on.",""
"Do you really want to waste the entire holiday here?",""
"We might as well have gone to our local pool.",""
"Oh please can we do something else.",""
"A hike perhaps?",""
"Honestly, I'd rather stay with my mother in peace... you know very well she can't walk that much!",""
"Ok, fine.",""
"We can do something that your mother can do as well then.",""
"How about the beach?",""
"She can read her book under a parasol and we can build sand castles!",""
"Why not, but I'm still enjoying the pool.",""
"Don't you want to do some laps?",""
"Yeah, but it gets boring.",""
"I've already done a couple of hundred laps today.",""
"If I do any more I'm going to start going really barmy.",""
"And I keep bumping into people swimming slowly.",""
"A little drink by the bar perhaps?",""
"Or a lolly?",""
"Maybe later.",""
"I'll watch you do your laps.",""
"But I don't want to do laps.",""
"I want to build sand castles, eat lollies, go on a hike.",""
"Anything but stay by the pool.",""
"What do you usually do on holiday?",""
"I read, I rest, I go out for a drink on the terrace... and you?",""
"I build sand castles eat lollies and go for walks, as I said.",""
"Well, would you prefer to go to the bar to get a drink?",""
"In about an hour?",""
"Or I could get you something if you really want.",""
"I just don't like staying still.",""
"I'll pay if you like.",""
"Ah!",""
"Will you get us some drinks?",""
"Yes, anything to get away from this poolside for five minutes.",""
"What do you want?",""
"I'm pretty sure they have just about everything here.",""
"Get me a coffee, please!",""
"If you want, you can take a ride with the dog, too.",""
"It'll make him feel better, and it'll make him happy.",""
"True.",""
"He looks a bit bored too.",""
"One coffee coming up!",""
"Sugar?",""
"Milk...?",""
"A coffee with sugar, thank you.",""
"Ask my mother to get something for her too!",""
"Ok, one coffee, two vodka shots and a Martini coming up!",""
"I'll be back in a minute.",""
"I'm not sure those ducks will love our old bread",""
"It should soften quite quickly in the water.",""
"Although I do hear bread isn't very good for ducks.",""
"They like peas apparently.",""
"They don't like bread?",""
"What did you bring for them?",""
"Not peas anyway!",""
"I never thought about it.",""
"Peas and green vegetables are better for them.",""
"I think the bread sinks and creates a messy pond - so I hear anyway.",""
"There are signs up saying not to give them bread.",""
"I love coming here though as it's very peaceful.",""
"Watching the ducks is very soothing.",""
"Well, I'm not giving any more bread.",""
"Yes, I also like this pond with the ducks and the swans.",""
"Do you come here often to relax?",""
"I work from home, so it's nice to go out for a few hours otherwise I don't see anyone all day.",""
"What about you?",""
"I come here often to read.",""
"Look at the ducks, pretty girls too... what do you do for work?",""
"I'm a writer.",""
"I'm writing a book about cats at the moment.",""
"What do you do?",""
"On cats?",""
"I love animals, but I'm allergic to polite animals.",""
"Otherwise, I'm a jazz musician.",""
"Yes, I love all kinds of animals too, but as I live in an apartment, it would be cruel to own one as they wouldn't have access to the outdoors.",""
"Ah jazz musician.",""
"What instrument/s do you play?",""
"I play the saxophone.",""
"I think it's an instrument with a wonderful sound.",""
"Sometimes the trumpet.",""
"I have to go, but where do you play?",""
"Maybe I could come along to hear you play.",""
"I hope so.",""
"Give me your e-mail, I'll send you the ad for our next gig.",""
"Help!",""
"Help!",""
"I'm lost in the deep woods, I don't know what happened.",""
"What was the last thing you remember?",""
"How did we end up here?",""
"Don't worry, I've ended up here too.",""
"I was going to pick mushrooms in a corner that I know very well.",""
"I walked away a little bit... and when I turned around, I didn't recognize anything.",""
"And you?",""
"What have you done?",""
"I was smoking by my favourite tree and then all of a sudden I'm here with you.",""
"And my head's a bit funny.",""
"Did you eat any of those mushrooms?",""
"No!",""
"No!",""
"They're poisoned!",""
"I'm making a magic potion, but I'm not telling you what to do!",""
"Well I should hope not.",""
"Nobody tells me what to do.",""
"Although if you're making a magic potion, I have to say that I would be very interested in trying some.",""
"I might even have some ingredients you could add...",""
"Oh, yeah?",""
"Really?",""
"What ingredients?",""
"Because it's a recipe for ancient magic potion with a mystery ingredient...",""
"Well, I'll give you that ingredient... it's...",""
"From the Vache Who Rit!",""
"I'm sorry.",""
"Ok.",""
"I'm not sure I understand what you mean.",""
"It's either the bump on the head I got or you've been eating way too many mushrooms!",""
"What on earth is the Vache Who Rit?",""
"A little bit of both.",""
"The Vache Rit!",""
"... Laughing cow in English:",""
"A grilled cheese made in Vosges.",""
"You seem very knowledgeable about it.",""
"And does it have hallucinogenic effects then?",""
"Is that why it's so popular?",""
"Yes, that's exactly what it is!",""
"But there are still many ingredients in this potion.",""
"This morning it's gonna be intense!",""
"We need to start preparing for the wedding!",""
"OK.",""
"Tell me what you'd like me to do first.",""
"What's the menu?",""
"I think you can already start to realize the butterscotch, the pie maker has already prepared the cabbages.",""
"We have a plan:",""
"A puff of vegetables, walnut oil and roquefort.",""
"Then a monkfish with bacon and contacts.",""
"With white wine",""
"That sounds nice.",""
"Are we have canapes?",""
"And dessert.",""
"How many people is it for?",""
"Yes, it'll be for the cocktail.",""
"There's salmon, caviar, and foie gras.",""
"You mean how many guests?",""
"Yes",""
"I think they'll be a hundred and twenty.",""
"Right I'll get going.",""
"I'll see if we've had a delivery of the food.",""
"All right, I'll continue to make dessert at the time.",""
"The fois gras is missing.",""
"Can we substitute it with duck?",""
"What dessert are you making?",""
"No, you don't!",""
"Are you serious?",""
"Oh, my God.",""
"We can actually try to replace it with duck magret, I guess...",""
"Sorry.",""
"I'm trying to do my best.",""
"Oh, don't worry, it's not your fault!",""
"I wonder what could have happened, we may have been misled on the command...",""
"Ouch!",""
"I've cut myself.",""
"I think I need a plaster.",""
"But you cut your finger!",""
"We have to go to the emergency room!",""
"I'm afraid of blood, I'm going to faint",""
"Oh, my God, I don't feel well.",""
"I'm gonna throw up.",""
"The day isn't going so well.",""
"Let's cancel the wedding.",""
"I see you're resourceful.",""
"That's exactly what we're gonna do.",""
"You call the bride and groom?",""
"Fab!",""
"A trip to the beach it is!",""
"Hi, honey, how was your day?",""
"It was so awful I don't know where to start!",""
"Firstly, the car broke down",""
"and it was pouring with rain so I got wet running for the train.",""
"The train was full so I had to stand all the way in to town.",""
"So eventually I arrived late for work.",""
"My boss is not happy.",""
"I don't get it.",""
"You dropped out of our car to catch the train?",""
"And the train being full you went on foot?",""
"I understand you were late for work.",""
"Ah ok.",""
"The car broke down so I had to leave it at the side of the road.",""
"I had to go to work by train.",""
"There were no seats on the train, but I could stand up.",""
"Does that make sense?",""
"Anyway, how was your day?",""
"Well, no, honey, I don't understand what happened to you.",""
"Me, my day has been excellent.",""
"But how did you get home?",""
"You left the car at work?",""
"No, the car is at the garage being mended.",""
"I think it is going to be expensive to fix.",""
"I'm glad you had a good day.",""
"Well, apart from that little transport problem, how are your relations with your boss?",""
"That's still the main problem.",""
"Well he was fine about it once I'd explained what had happened.",""
"I have to make the time up tomorrow, so I'll be late home from work.",""
"We have tickets to go to the theatre tomorrow too!",""
"No!",""
"Your boss invites you to the theater?",""
"I'm not sure I agree.",""
"No, we have tickets darling, but it might mean we are a bit late as I have to work late.",""
"You and I are going to the theatre.",""
"Right.",""
"I'm hungry and it's now too late to cook.",""
"Shall we go out to dinner?",""
"I love the theater.",""
"Which play will be played?",""
"I'm hungry, too, we can go to the restaurant if you want.",""
"Wonderful!",""
"Let's go to dinner and chat more then.",""
"Hi!",""
"So, it's my birthday next week, and I'd like to throw a big party!",""
"Great!",""
"I love parties!",""
"What are you planning on doing?",""
"A big one or just a couple of friends?",""
"I'm not sure, but a big party with all my friends.",""
"At my place it's not big enough, can I rent a room or book a bar?",""
"You could, although you'll have to hurry before it's too late.",""
"I'll help you if you like.",""
"Thank you very much!",""
"It's probably too late to rent a room then.",""
"Do you know a nice bar nearby, and mostly big enough?",""
"Yeah sure.",""
"There's The King's Head.",""
"It's more of a pub than a bar, but you should be able to book a space.",""
"And the bartender's an idiot, so you could always hire him as a jester!",""
"Only kidding... but they do allow you to bring your own entertainment if you want.",""
"Thank you, that's great advice!",""
"I just called them, they said yes!",""
"So we have the back room, it's big enough, starting from 7: 00.",""
"So that's your alcohol sorted.",""
"What do you think about the entertainment idea?",""
"I know a man who knows a man who knows a busker, who might be able to come along and play a bit of guitar.",""
"I'd like to bring strippers in... do you think the bartender would accept?",""
"Ha ha ha!",""
"Seriously, you're right about the musicians.",""
"I have a friend who's in a music group, so I'm going to ask him to come out and play a little!",""
"Great!",""
"Are they any good?",""
"I can't think of anything worse than a rubbish band playing all night.",""
"No offense to your friend...",""
"Uh, they just started out, actually, they're a little beginner...",""
"Actually it's an experimental group, they combine a lot of music styles!",""
"They play the accordion, the banjo, the drum and the recorder!",""
"Do you think it might spoil the evening?",""
"Nah, should be alright.",""
"I'm a massive fan of the banjo, so it should be a blast!",""
"I'm really looking forward to it now!",""
"Thank God!",""
"Now all we have to do is send out the invitations.",""
"You'll be the first to receive the invitation, of course.",""
"Great!",""
"I'm gonna go and buy a brand new dress to wear!",""
"We absolutely need to go shopping!",""
"Excuse me, are you all right?",""
"No, I'm not.",""
"I'm on an aeroplane and I am very scared.",""
"Is this the first time you've been on a plane?",""
"No.",""
"I'm a frequent flyer.",""
"What about you?",""
"I take the plane too often.",""
"But you're still afraid of flying, though you're a regular?",""
"That's surprising!",""
"Did you have a bad experience?",""
"The person next to me was sick all over me and you yourself look rather ill.",""
"Oh, no, I'm fine, thank you.",""
"I have a rather pale complexion, that's all.",""
"You're the one who seems to be really stressed.",""
"Don't worry, everything's going to be fine.",""
"Are you sure?",""
"You look more green than pale.",""
"Really?",""
"If you're right, I hope it's nothing serious.",""
"Yes.",""
"But maybe it's the lighting in here.",""
"But if I start having problems of digestion, I have a simple solution:",""
"I'm also afraid of flight.",""
"It's not natural.",""
"Can I hold your hand please?",""
"Mind you, whiskey is perfect for stress, too.",""
"Uh... if you want.",""
"If I have any more alcohol I may be sick on you.",""
"Would you like a whiskey?",""
"No thank you.",""
"Just the hand please.",""
"All right.",""
"But I'm gonna get a whiskey, though.",""
"Now we've taken off, I'm going to get off.",""
"All the best.",""
"Oh, God, they only have Jack Daniels.",""
"Why don't they have Scottish whiskey?",""
"It's not the same thing!",""
"Oh yes, we've finally landed.",""
"All right, good day to you.",""
"Have a safe onward journey",""
"For tonight's meal, we're waiting for 10 people...",""
"I suggest we see to think together on the menu.",""
"Do you mean there are ten customers or are they late?",""
"There will be ten clients, who booked for tonight, at twenty o'clock.",""
"Oh I understand now!",""
"What shall we cook?",""
"That's the question.",""
"I understand there was a movie star...",""
"Are any of them vegetarian or even vegan?",""
"Then we must not disappoint them.",""
"Which movie star is coming?",""
"Do you think I could get them to autograph a napkin?",""
"Tom Hanks.",""
"I hear he's very nice.",""
"Maybe we can get an autograph at the end.",""
"I think my favourite film was Forrest Gump.",""
"And I don't think he's a vegetarian.",""
"Well when he was on that island in Castaway he must have eaten meat!",""
"We could schedule a carpaccio of saint chatter in the entrance.",""
"What do you mean?",""
"We're just going to get the scallops.",""
"We'll get the edible part, and cut it into thin slices.",""
"Perhaps we could use them as a starter and then do a meat dish.",""
"Then marinate in lemon juice.",""
"I think it can make a nice entrance.",""
"Yeah, it's a good idea to put on a meat plate!",""
"You got any ideas?",""
"What about roast breast of pigeon with beetroot, dauphine potatoes and a blackberry jus?",""
"You mean blackberries?",""
"Or a blackberry pie to finish?",""
"I mean a blackberry sauce to go with the pigeon.",""
"It's a good idea, original, which will probably enjoy our living.",""
"What about dessert?",""
"Maybe we could make a lemon pie?",""
"Or chocolate macaroons?",""
"I'm glad you like my ideas.",""
"I got them from watching Masterchef on television.",""
"Really?",""
"I like lemon pie.",""
"Perhaps with Chantilly cream?",""
"I watch that show, too!",""
"It's good to see you.",""
"It's been a long time and since I don't have a lot of visitors.",""
"Good to see you too !",""
"Sorry I haven’t visited in so long.",""
"I’ve just come back from my holiday",""
"Are you coming back from vacation?",""
"All right.",""
"Where did you go this year?",""
"I have a few walks around the nursing home.",""
"Yes, I have just returned from my honeymoon in Hawaii",""
"That’s great , have you made any friends here yet?",""
"Hawaii?",""
"Fabulous!",""
"What have you done?",""
"Sea-fishing, boat walks...?",""
"If not, yes, I made a few friends here with whom I speak music, literature, not to forget chess parts!",""
"We explored the volcanoes on the island , lay on the beach and enjoyed the glorious sunsets.",""
"I'd like to visit Hawaii.",""
"And where are you going to live now?",""
"Do you still have your math teacher position?",""

"My boss was so angry with me.",""
"She told me that if we cannot get the money back then I'll need to find the 1 billion euros myself.",""
"Isn't there another way?",""
"No way!",""
"I don't know.",""
"If we cannot get the money back, can you give me 1 billion euros to pay back to the company?",""
"But we don't have it!",""
"Isn't it possible to get a lawyer?",""
"Yes, I think you're right.",""
"We should get a lawyer and explain that this was a mistake.",""
"But if the lawyer can't help us then maybe we should ask a sorcerer to help us to cast a spell on my boss.",""
"Do you know any good sorcerers?",""
"Not in particular.",""
"But we'll probably find some in the forest",""
"I don't like going into the woods.",""
"Could you go for me and find the best sorcerer for less than 1 billion euros?",""
"Are you stupid?",""
"Pay even more?",""
"What if it doesn't work?",""
"I said for less than 1 billion euros not more than 1 billion euros.",""
"Where will I get a billion euros?",""
"My parents won't lend me that kind of money.",""

"Absolutely!",""

"We had a huge lunch...",""
"Exactly, the boardwalk's good for the digestion!",""
"I find that sleeping can be quite efficient too!",""
"Why are you so keen to go for a walk?",""
"Doing laps in a small pool, that's not very original.",""
"While there's a little forest road right next to it.",""

"What would you like?",""
"I'll have a caipirinha.",""
"With a few olives and sausage rings if possible.",""
"Certainly, sir.",""
"One caipirinha coming up.",""
"Here you are, and your olives, but I'm sorry we don't have any sausage rings.",""
"You don't have a sausage?",""
"It's okay.",""
"I'm surprised you know the caipirinha.",""
"This is not a very common aperitif in Europe.",""
"Where did you learn to do that?",""
"I have been a bartender for a few years and I've worked in a lot of different places.",""
"I also did some training while working in a famous bar in London.",""
"Awesome!",""
"It's a hell of a experience.",""
"Which country did you go to?",""
"What's your favorite aperitif?",""
"I've spent time in France, Germany and South America.",""
"I don't have a favourite aperitif myself - I don't drink much at all, really only at special occasions where I like a glass of champagne.",""
"Yes, a glass of champagne is always, everywhere, an excellent aperitif.",""
"You've traveled a lot!",""
"Which country did you enjoy the most?",""
"South America was really interesting, different from home.",""
"I did some travelling and there was so much to see.",""
"Yes, a lot to see in South America.",""
"Have you been able to go to Argentina, or see the ruins?",""
"Which ruins?",""
"There were a few.",""
"I hope you still could have gone to Machu Picchu.",""
"You bring back memories of these South American countries?",""
"So you've been there yourself?",""
"I sure.",""
"And in Mexico City.",""
"I brought in some very beautiful stones.",""
"Are you interested in mineralogy?",""
"I've met some gold-diggers in my time, but other than that, it's not something I know anything about.",""
"Good evening.",""
"So how was your day?",""
"My day SUCKED.",""
"How was yours?",""
"Mine was fine.",""
"As scheduled.",""
"But you had a difficult meeting in perspective...",""
"The main problem was that I couldn't find a place to eat.",""
"I was starved, and you know how hangry I get... I walked around for, like, an hour.",""
"One place after the other was closed, closed, CLOSED.",""
"But, tell me about your day.",""
"Being a little hangry is not like starving to death in Syria... We have to be aware of what the REAL problems are--and aren't.",""
"You mean after your meeting, you tried to isolate yourself to eat but couldn't find a quiet room?",""
"Bad luck.",""
"I know when you need calm, you really need to calm down!",""
"True, true.",""
"How was YOUR day?",""
"My day has been quiet.",""
"A good productive meeting this morning and this afternoon I was able to finish my report.",""
"Have you managed to calm down for lunch?",""
"Other than that, my day was actually pretty good... I spent most of the day writing something that I wanted to work on.",""
"Ah.",""
"That's good.",""
"And what did you write about?",""
"Lunch was fine.",""
"I had a bowl of chirashi--yum!",""
"I wrote about ... hm, what did I write about--I'm getting too old to remember ANYTHING... I wrote about the kinds of information that needs to be recorded in order to repeat and to interpret an experiment.",""
"How about you--what was your meeting about, and what was your report about?",""
"Who was at the meeting, and did everyone behave themselves?",""
"What's a bowl of chirashi-yum?",""
"I've never had it.",""
"The meeting was pretty good.",""
"There must be some trouble.",""
"It's a bit heavy to wear.",""
"But we made it.",""
"That's good.",""
"Anything interesting on the news?",""
"No more than that.",""
"You know that takes time these things.",""
"What about your side?",""
"The usual criminals in the White House.",""
"Trump being an asshole.",""
"Trump being an idiot.",""
"Same ol', same ol'.",""
"OK, I must run out to the store and pick up some coffee.",""
"I'll be back soon--do you want me to pick up anything?",""
"But who's an asshole?",""
"The president of the Us?",""
"Yes--by definition.",""
"You should read the book 'Assholes: A Theory.' It's a philosopher's take on what, exactly, an asshole is, and why they are as they are, and why they so infuriate us.",""
"It was written in 2010--in other words, long before the current hell--and he talks about Trump at some length!",""
"OK, I'm outta here.",""
"Back in a bit.",""
"Why do we learn about History?",""
"But mademoiselle, history is a very important discipline.",""
"It allows you to understand the present and prepare the future as a student of the past.",""
"And then it's part of the general culture of all educated people.",""
"Not knowing the story is come from nowhere and be lost in the present.",""
"Why does school not teach us more about the negatives of debt and looking after our mental health?",""
"Every teacher specializes in discipline.",""
"I agree with you that certain subjects are not treated enough.",""
"But the story is very important.",""
"It's also in the story that we understand what democracy is, politics, the cultural identity of his country.",""
"And it doesn't fascinate you, ancient civilizations?",""
"The birth of writing?",""
"Yes I suppose it is very interesting, but it does not feel very relevant to the present",""
"Yes, it is, because the story often repeats itself.",""
"Studying the consequences of decisions that were taken in the past allows you to understand what the right decisions to make today!",""
"Let's take an example.",""
"After the first world war, the winners have decided to ask for some very high repairs in Germany.",""
"It meant a fortune.",""
"It ruined the German economy, and drove indirectly into World War II.",""
"After the second world war, the winners understood because of what it was that we didn't have to make the same mistake again.",""
"And they built Europe instead.",""
"And now we've lived in peace for 70 years in Europe.",""
"That is true.",""
"Do you think that one day in the future children will not need to learn to write with a pen and just use a computer instead?",""
"I don't think so.",""
"You'll always have to be able to write letters, sign documents...",""
"But what are you interested in?",""
"What are the subjects that seem useful to you?",""
"I am very passionate about looking after the planet",""
"And making sure that we look after it",""
"by recycling, being mindful of the ocean and finding new sources of energy",""
"Yes, they're very important subjects, you're right.",""
"Are you planning to study in this field?",""
"I would like to study more about the planet and how we can change our behaviour for the better",""
"But I also really enjoy reading and theatre",""
"You might want to start looking into which schools there are cursus that might interest you.",""
"But the environment is a very exciting and very important discipline for our future, so I encourage you in this path!",""
"Do I need a University Degree to get a job working to change the environment?",""
"Depends on what you want to do.",""
"We don't need a college degree to change his behavior daily, and to encourage people to do the same.",""
"But if you want to go further, for example in research or engineering, then you'll need skills and degrees that only higher studies can give you.",""
"If we all used computers at school it would be better for the planet!",""
"How about iPads instead of paper note books?",""
"I think my fellow students would be very happy",""
"You should look into it, because producing computers and iPads are very polluted.",""
"While paper can be produced in a way-in-the-way environment, replanting the trees.",""
"Why is producing computers and iPads very polluting?",""
"Because today, we don't know how to produce them without polluting.",""
"Electronic devices contain many toxic chemicals, for example, in the batteries, the monitors, the chips.",""
"I think about the semi-drivers, who are almost exclusively products in China, in very polluted mines.",""
"But you can talk to your physics teacher, if you're interested.",""
"I have to leave now, because the next class starts in one minute!",""
"See you next week!",""
"Thank you!",""
"Could you please wash your hands after touching your face",""
"It is vital that we maintain good hygiene",""
"You're right.",""
"I'll wash my hands right now!",""
"What do you want us to do next for tonight's menu?",""
"Great, I am pleased we have cleared the ground rules",""
"What is on the menu for tonight, do you remember?",""
"It seems to me that we should be planning an entrance with fish.",""
"Then a dish with meat, and then dessert with red fruit.",""
"Your are very good at inventing special dishes with fresh produce",""
"What shall we do with the bream?",""
"It is lovely and fresh, something simple I suggest that won't detract from the flavour",""
"What exactly do you mean, Bram, I'm not sure I understand.",""
"Bream is a small white fish, slightly like sea bass I guess",""
"Thank you for your precision.",""
"Maybe we can marinate it in lemon, and with a little olive oil?",""
"In order to serve him in the entrance, along with some fresh vegetables?",""
"I think if you fillet it, then fry it lightly and serve with a lemon and olive oil emulsion",""
"I think we could just prepare it and serve with a little seaweed as it is a starter",""
"Oh, yeah, that's a great idea!",""
"The algae will bring a small side, and it's original!",""
"There are plenty of fresh strawberries, perhaps you could start by mascerating them in sugar and some liqueur",""
"If you get those started",""
"Of course.",""
"What do you think of the healthy eating initiative that the Government are getting involved in?",""
"Maybe we could make a little lemon pie with the strawberries?",""
"Obesity in France is not such a problem as it is in England",""
"Do you think I am right about that?",""
"The object became a global problem.",""
"But with good stuff, you can make you want to eat better.",""
"Bearing that in mind I think we should leave the lemon pies and concentrate on a lighter menu",""
"You're right.",""
"Thanks for your suggestions today, good bye",""
"Excuse me.",""
"I'm trying to have a relaxing time here and I'd prefer not to be disturbed.",""
"Thank you.",""
"Okay.",""
"But it's already over an hour ago that we're here.",""
"We could go to town for a while.",""
"I've seen the town and I'm not impressed.",""
"I'd much rather just laze here in the sun and perhaps read a chapter or two of my book.",""
"I'm really getting into the story and I think it's going to become quite exciting soon.",""
"Okay, suit yourself.",""
"What is this exciting book you're reading?",""
"A detective novel?",""
"It's a kind of detective novel.",""
"The main character is a genealogist and he is trying to make sense of a family story about smugglers and a cache of gold sovereigns.",""
"That sounds like a curious story to me.",""
"I'm gonna go get my science fiction book.",""
"That's better.",""
"Would you like a drink?",""
"Gosh!",""
"I thought you weren't going to ask.",""
"I'd love an Aperol spritz.",""
"Just as a matter of interest; why is a science fiction book better?",""
"I find many of then just too far fetched to be believable.",""
"I suppose it takes all sorts to make the world!",""
"Because the history of the first men who come to Mars and find traces of a very old civilisation, it's much more interesting than your history of genealogist and treasure!",""
"As I said; it takes all sorts.",""
"My book is partly based on fact.",""
"It imagines things that might have happened to a real smuggling gang and incorporates some recent discoveries of a couple of walled-up skeletons.",""
"As far as I understand it, there is very little likelihood of an old civilisation occurring on Mars - at least not a form of life we'd recognise - there's a poor atmosphere and little water.",""
"The probability of finding ruins on Mars is indeed small.",""
"I'll give you that.",""
"That says I don't hate crime novels.",""
"Agatha Christie's for example.",""
"Have you read it?",""
"I have read some of Agatha Christie's novels.",""
"I'm not a great fan because they are rather formulaic.",""
"What I do find fascinating about her is the question of what she did when she disappeared and some people thought that she had committed suicide.",""
"Well, I'll give you 15 more minutes with your genealogist.",""
"Then we'll go to lunch.",""
"Good morning!",""
"You've seen all those ducks!",""
"I see you feed them, too... what is it?",""
"They're mallards and coots.",""
"They really like eating frozen peas",""
"But you defrost them before, right?",""
"Do they like other things?",""
"Yes, it's better to defrost them first.",""
"I think they like vegetation, but I'm not too sure what else",""
"Do you know if there is a cafe close by to here?",""
"Wait...",""
"But it's not close and I don't know if it's open on Sunday.",""
"We have to go a little longer along the pond and then roll up the river for a hundred yards.",""
"Then there's this round-point and you won't be able to miss it.",""
"I recommend the fish and chips.",""
"Even though I think their peas are frozen as well!",""
"Ah, okay.",""
"Do you know what it's called.",""
"Haha!",""
"I like fish and chips - it's a very English dish!",""
"Duck with orange sauce is a favourite of mine too.",""
"What's your favourite dish?",""
"I think it's called 'The King of the pond,' but I'm not sure.",""
"I like fish and chips a lot, but I don't eat much meat.",""
"I prefer vegetables and fish / shellfish.",""
"Ducks - I prefer them in the pond than on my plate!",""
"So you're a pescatorian?",""
"Ah ah ah... in a way yes!",""
"But now that I think about it, I think that coffee makes orange duck as well.",""
"I don't know if it's any good, you should try it!",""
"Okay I will.",""
"Are you a good cook?",""
"All this talk of food is making me hungry",""
"Yes, I understand!",""
"See you!",""
"Good evening!",""
"What do you have on the pressure?",""
"On the pressure?",""
"i don't follow.",""
"I am pretty stressed out with work at the moment.",""
"is that what you mean?",""
"No, I just wanted to ask what the beers you have on the shooter.",""
"If you have wine, I'll be fine, too.",""
"oh!",""
"sorry!",""
"we have some craft beer from West Virginia that's is quite bitter but very refreshing",""
"i wouldn't recommend the wine because we only have cask wine and it is failry awful",""
"after all, we are beer specialists",""
"Perfect!",""
"I like a lot of bitter beer.",""
"Could you pour me a pint?",""
"if you like a lot of bitter beer, may i suggest going for the full stein of Löwenbrau.",""
"a whole litre of a very drinkable beer",""
"granted, some may see it as being a rather comercial beer, but it is still a solid choice",""
"Then I'll have a whole liter!",""
"Thank you!",""
"What do you have to eat?",""
"remember, drink responsibly.",""
"to eat?",""
"let me see",""
"you're going to need something hearty to soak up all that beer",""
"it looks like you going to be having quite a big night tonight",""
"I'm still in charge!",""
"I'll take a cab.",""
"how about our burger platter.",""
"sound good?",""
"Perfect!",""
"a selection of 30 miniature burgers, each with it's own unique cheese and meat combo",""
"But I don't like onions.",""
"Do you have a burger without onions?",""
"I don't want to be difficult.",""
"we can do all of our burgers without onions if you prefer",""
"30 burger platter, hold the onions.",""
"i'll put the order through",""
"as we say, the customer is always right.",""
"Put on a lot of cheese, especially!",""
"I'm gonna need a lot of beer to pass all those burgers.",""
"Bring me another one soon.",""
"Good morning, Doctor.",""
"Good morning.",""
"Now, tell me.",""
"What's been going on?",""
"I need to talk to you.",""
"Can I sit in this chair?",""
"No, that's mine.",""
"But you can sit anywhere else.",""
"Or if you prefer, you can lie down there.",""
"Some people prefer that.",""
"Can I lie on this couch?",""
"Are you sure?",""
"I don't want to bother, he looks clean and new, I'm kind of worried about sitting on it.",""
"I don't want to ruin it.",""
"I think it would make me feel better to stand.",""
"Would you like me to take my shoes off?",""
"Notice how bad my feet feel, I don't know too much what would be best.",""
"Calm down, please.",""
"Please don't worry.",""
"Aren't you hot?",""
"Please just make yourself at home.",""
"But there's no need to panic.",""
"So, if you're feeling comfortable, what's been going on?",""
"I think my neighbors think I want to hurt them.",""
"So I'm afraid to stay at home and try to make the least noise.",""
"But it's tiring.",""
"I don't belong anywhere, you know.",""
"I'm sure there's somewhere you fit in.",""
"Have you always felt like this?",""
"I don't know.",""
"But I think it's getting harder for me in time.",""
"Plus, my new neighbors are weird.",""
"They always look at me with a strange look.",""
"I think they're listening to what I'm doing through the walls.",""
"Do you listen to them through the walls too?",""
"Oh, no, I'd be too afraid if they found out I was listening.",""
"But I still hear them.",""
"The walls aren't that thick.",""
"That's why I feel like I'm watching.",""
"But I don't have the money to move into a house.",""
"Oh, so you live in a flat at the moment?",""
"Yes, I did, didn't I tell you earlier?",""
"I'm sorry.",""
"Maybe you did.",""
"No worries.",""
"But you never had problems with the old neighbours then?",""
"She was an old person who didn't hear anything and make no noise.",""
"I didn't feel at home.",""
"Well, that will give us a good basis to start with next time.",""
"I'm afraid our time is up for today.",""
"I've got lots of other patients to see.",""
"And a blind date this lunchtime!",""
"Please sign out at reception when you leave.",""
"Okay, thanks for your time, I'm sorry I bothered you.",""
"And I'm sorry I'm always sorry...",""
"I'm sorry.",""
"Good morning, ma'am.",""
"I'm having a hard time understanding the odds.",""
"It's too complicated for me that's done only literature so far!",""
"Help me, please!",""
"Well, I am an English teacher, so I'm not sure I'll be much help...",""
"Do you not like Mr Jameson?",""
"He's your maths teacher, right?",""
"I would understand - he can sometimes come across as a bit intimidating.",""
"Start by telling me what you understand.",""
"I know you're an English teacher, but Mr. Jameson is a bully!",""
"All he does is put us down, and remind us that he's intellectually superior.",""
"I can't take it anymore, and I'm not the only one.",""
"Besides, he keeps harassing my friends.",""
"Oh dear.",""
"Maybe we need to have a proper discussion about that at some point.",""
"Have you contacted anybody about that?",""
"There is a school counsellor on site every Tuesday.",""
"That's the thing.",""
"They're plotting together in order not to let any of the information escape.",""
"Just talking to you puts me in grave danger.",""
"I really didn't know it was this serious.",""
"Don't worry, we'll do something about it.",""
"And never be too scared to talk out about it.",""
"How long has it been going on?",""
"It's been going on since we dared to tell him his course was going too fast.",""
"He's got too much ego and can't stand a contradiction.",""
"Since he's friends with the councilman, he's getting revenge.",""
"However, now that he's aware of his power, he also goes after my friends because they're girls.",""
"Now they hate me because they think it's my fault.",""
"Oh dear.",""
"This really does sound serious.",""
"I'm going to have to organise a meeting to discuss this.",""
"This needs to be sorted out quickly.",""
"I'll talk to the head and see what we can do to investigate, and I'll let you know.",""
"And don't worry, I'll do it quickly!",""
"Thank you so much!",""
"I hope he can rot in jail for the rest of his life, eaten by rats.",""
"So Germaine, how are you today?",""
"So, so, but much better than yesterday, thank you.",""
"How are you?",""
"How are those lovely grandchildren of yours?",""
"Three is it now or am I miscounting!",""

"It's just all these little pains, it doesn't make life easy!",""
"My grandkids are fine, the last one, Marion's daughter my second daughter, you know, just made her first steps!",""
"As a parent you're not supposed to have favourites, but Marion has been such a lovely daughter.",""
"I'm guessing her child is just as beautiful as she is.",""
"Did you bring in any photographs?",""
"Pains, don't talk to me about pains.",""
"I can barely walk these days",""
"Ah, how I understand you!",""
"It's true that Marion was always the little girl of everyone... kind of like your Oliver, wasn't she?",""
"I don't have any pictures with me, you know, the technology and I... my kids gave me a tablet, but I don't know what to do with it!",""
"For your arthritis, fortunately, you're here, right?",""
"The staff seems very caring.",""
"Oliver gave me a tablet my birthday.",""
"I use it for watching TV and reading books.",""
"He showed me how it works, but if I get stuck the girls in here will always help me.",""
"They are very kind.",""
"Ah, you must be cleverer than me then!",""
"My children often show me how to turn it on and even how to write e-mails, but...",""
"With my poor head, it's too difficult!",""
"Young people go so fast!",""
"Everything has to go fast for them...",""
"Oliver spent ages showing how to switch it on, charge it up, how to send emails.",""
"Watching YouTube, listening to the radio, they're easy.",""
"I have to get someone to download the books for me.",""
"You should really try it - you can set the font size so it's much easier for our old eyes to read the print.",""
"Well, if you say so, I'll hold on!",""
"Still, we live in crazy, crazy times!",""
"It's all happening so fast!",""
"At last!",""
"My dear Germaine, I'm going to have to leave you, I have an appointment at the rheumatologist at 3: 00!",""
"By the time we get there... as always, it's been a pleasure to see you.",""
"Good luck and do come and visit me again soon.",""
"Next time, though, bring those photographs, oh, and if you can carry them some grapes, a box of milk chocolates and the Sunday newspapers.",""
"Love to the family x",""
"go on, tell me what happened.",""
"why do you look so down in the dumps?",""
"I was fine until you saw your head.",""
"I can't stand you anymore",""
"wow.",""
"i was not expecting that.",""
"what did I do?",""
"You've seen how you talk to me you're not even able to say good night.",""
"I demand consideration and mutual respect in a marriage.",""
"With you it's always a one-way street, you get on my nerves and I realize I'll be way better away from you.",""
"how long have you been feeling like this?",""
"Why do get the impression this is the first time you've mentioned anything going wrong between us?",""
"I'm like Louis Jouvet in the children of Heaven, when he tells Arletty he needs a change of air.",""
"You remember that beautiful Marcel Carborn, we saw it in French.",""
"i have no idea what you're talking about.",""
"But, i'm going to go with you on this one and assume that it has just slipped my mind.",""
"so, yeah, sure, i remember your stupid film.",""
"it probably sucked.",""
"and that's why I can't remember it.",""
"i never liked french movies anyway.",""

"look who's talking, Mr 6 centimetres of disappointment! 'real man', honestly.",""
"you make me sick",""
"i tried to hear you out, but you just came at me.",""
"I'm through with you.",""

"Hello!",""
"It's Julie!",""
"I was calling you about my birthday.",""
"You know, Saturday's Saturday party, you offered to help me with the organization.",""
"Actually, I'd like that.",""
"It's turning into a hell of a party!",""
"Great!",""
"What time do you want me to come over?",""
"Well, if we could have a date two hours before, it wouldn't be bad.",""
"We're gonna have to finish the glassware and pull the silverware and the plates.",""
"And the drinks, too.",""
"Either inside, or in the garden, depends on time.",""
"It could depend a bit on the weather.",""
"Do you know what the forecast is?",""
"Shall I bring those lovely balloons with me, and a few party poppers?",""
"Balloons, yes, why not!",""
"Weather changes every day, it's hard to predict... Sinon, so I also ordered a barrel of beer so I could get some pressure.",""
"People always like that.",""
"But I could really use some help wearing it and set it up...",""
"Have you been drinking already?",""
"A barrel of beer would be great.",""
"There are a few sailors coming along and they love barrelled beer!",""
"Shall I bring some red or white wine?",""
"Or both?",""
"Both!",""
"If there are sailors, there's gonna be a wide range on the drinks.",""
"Do you think we're gonna need rum?",""
"Rum is a must for sailors.",""
"We don't want to upset them and cause a mutiny.",""
"I love sailors...",""
"No!",""
"But we're gonna have to blackmail them.",""
"Are they in the merchant navy, or are there some pirates?",""
"Pirates are the best, especially the rum!",""
"I love sailors too.",""
"We could blackmail them into singing sea shanties!",""
"There's one I know with lots of tattoos, a patch on his eye, and a parrot on his shoulder.",""
"Maybe he is a pirate?",""
"And we'll dance!",""
"In fact, it gives me a lot of ideas about decorating and costumes!",""
"You'll have to introduce me.",""
"He has a parrot?",""
"I prefer parrots with tattoos.",""
"Well, I'm gonna take a look at the decorations and call you back before the party.",""
"Thanks for your help!",""
"And if you ever get any ideas, don't hesitate to call me back.",""
"I gotta go!",""
"Are you okay, honey?",""
"You don't look like you're in a good mood.",""
"You would not believe the day I've had.",""
"I never want to go back to work again!",""
"Everything that could go wrong went wrong.",""
"I mean I even got my hair stuck in the photocopier!",""
"Oh, you poor thing.",""
"What happened to you?",""
"Somebody came to rescue me, thankfully.",""
"But just...just everything seemed to go wrong today...",""
"I even managed to spill coffee over my boss.",""
"Who wasn't very happy.",""
"I mean it wasn't really my fault...",""
"Ouch!",""
"This is the kind of day we would've preferred not to get up in the morning.",""
"Would a little massage do you good?",""
"Or a good beer?",""
"Ah yes please!",""
"For the massage, not for the beer.",""
"Though I wouldn't mind some of the good rum.",""
"Okay for a massage and a rum.",""
"And what did your boss say?",""
"He was mad at you?",""
"After he'd finished flapping his arms around, he did say something not particularly nice - something about his new shirt.",""
"Well he couldn't really have fired for me that.",""
"But he did have a bit of a go - and in front of the entire office!",""
"It's okay, with everything he wins, he'll buy another one!",""
"And then it can happen to anyone!",""
"Anyway, your boss has always been fond of you.",""
"Really?",""
"Isn't that a bit weird?",""
"I mean he's twice my age.",""
"And that would be a bit inappropriate...",""
"Maybe that's why Pauline doesn't like me...",""
"Why do you think she doesn't love you?",""
"Aren't you a little paranoid?",""
"Allow me to point out that you are in your fifth whiskey.",""
"Is that all!",""
"I've have another double please.",""
"Could I also look at the food menu, as perhaps I should eat something?",""
"Yes, eating something with mineral water is a good idea.",""
"Here's the menu.",""
"Let me try a malt whiskey this time with an ice cube.",""
"Now, what shall I eat?",""
"Can I have a sirloin steak with french fries and a side salad?",""
"Sorry, we don't serve this dish till noon.",""
"And I suggest you only take the ice cube without the whiskey.",""
"Why, have you run out of whiskey?",""
"I'll have a bottle of beaujolais instead then.",""
"Can you serve peanuts before noon, as I'm feeling a bit peckish?",""
"I suggest you take a break from alcohol.",""
"Really!",""
"It's not even noon yet and I haven't even started.",""
"I might have to take my custom elsewhere is you're not happy to serve me.",""
"I repeat, you've already taken four whiskeys.",""
"Are you going to take the wheel on your way out?",""
"I won't be leaving you a very good review on Tripadvisor.",""
"You call yourself a bar but won't serve me.",""
"Discriminating against alcoholics!",""
"I'm not allowed to serve drunk clients.",""
"I'm not drunk, I'm still standing!",""
"But your words are inconsistent, and I can't figure out if it's in effect from the slip of the Diabla translation, or a reflection of your mental state.",""
"Haha!",""
"I'm fine, it must be the Diabla, so I'll have another whiskey please!",""
"You're still up, but I suggest you go to bed.",""
"That will be my last word.",""
"The bar round the corner will serve me without a problem. They'll be glad of my custom.",""
"Good morning, Doctor.",""
"This is the first time I've been seeing a little nervous.",""
"So, how has your week been?",""
"I'm having trouble at work.",""
"Well, you have a very challenging job being a librarian.",""
"What exactly has happened?",""
"I feel like the staff aren't too many of them.",""
"I run around all day, following orders from my boss,",""
"Last time I felt like I had a panic attack, I locked myself in the bathroom to cry.",""
"I don't know what to do, what can you advise me?",""
"First of all, I think it's important that you get adequate support, so speak to your line manager and see if they can send staff possibly from another library to help your workload.",""
"It's a situation which is presently counter productive because if you are stressed and need to take time off, it will only make the staffing situation worse.",""
"Hopefully your boss will be able to appreciate that.",""
"I can give you some anti depressants.",""
"Would you be happy with that?",""
"Yeah, I could go talk to him, but I'm afraid, he's on edge right now.",""
"Last time he didn't greet me very well.",""
"Send him to me - I need more clients!",""
"He didn't greet you well?",""
"What exactly did he do?",""
"Haha, that would be an idea.",""
"Maybe he's gonna cry in the bathroom every once in a while.",""
"We should do group therapy.",""
"He didn't give me time to explain my situation, and threw me out of his office with more work than before!",""
"I would report him to someone higher up the chain.",""
"He may be suffering himself, but bullying you needs reporting.",""
"My goodness, your work environment doesn't sound very happy and uplifting.",""
"Perhaps someone is going around putting drugs in your food.",""
"Are your catering department reliable?",""
"I must admit, when I taste the meals we serve, I ask questions...",""
"Besides, there's no time to take a nap from the workload, it's a scandal!",""
"It sounds rather suspicious to me.",""
"If you could sneak out from there, some small food samples, I can send them away to get tested.",""
"You can taste it, but I'm warning you, it's terrible.",""
"Don't worry, I wouldn't taste it myself.",""
"If my suspicions are correct, to do so, would mean coming down with depression.",""
"I can't take time off and I like being happy.",""
"Anyway, lovely to see you again, and we'll speak again when you get the samples.",""
"Goodbye!",""
"Thank you for your help, Doctor.",""
"It was a pleasure talking to you today!",""
"It's a lovely day for feeding ducks.",""
"That's true, but I like to come here even when it rains.",""
"After all, ducks eat every day!",""
"Do you come here often?",""
"My first time at this particular pond.",""
"Are you new to the neighborhood?",""
"No, I am just passing through.",""
"I have a few hours to spare before catching my train.",""
"Oh, where are you going?",""
"Now that would be telling.",""
"Just on the way to Cirencester.",""
"The funny thing is I have no idea where I am now.",""
"We're in the Alan Turing Foundation.",""
"For me, it's especially the closest park in my house.",""
"And since he's got a pond and some ducks, I come here a lot.",""
"I like ducks a lot.",""
"How did Alan Turing find the park?",""
"I suppose he just looked around and there it was.",""
"lucky for me I had some bread in my bag or the ducks would have gone home with empty stomachs.",""
"I'll have some more if you want.",""
"I always bring too much.",""
"And there's a lot of kids, sometimes grown-ups, and they're happy that I give them some bread to throw in the ducks.",""
"No that is alright.",""
"I can hear my train whistle blwoing so I should run.",""
"Nice talking to you.",""
"Hello!",""
"How nice to see you!",""
"What a pleasure to meet you.",""
"How are you?",""
"I'm as well as can be expected.",""
"I've got my aches and pains but at 93 I can't grumble.",""
"How are you and the children?",""
"They must be growing up fast.",""
"It's hard sometimes to get old.",""
"I understand.",""
"And 93 is an age beyond honor and you always have a good eye.",""
"The kids are fine, thank you.",""
"They're almost grown now.",""
"Paul's studying architecture.",""
"That's marvellous.",""
"And what about Emma?",""
"She had a talent for music if I remember.",""
"Emma's a senior scientist in high school.",""
"She's graduating this year.",""
"She goes on with the music and part of a symphony orchestra.",""
"That's good to hear that she has kept the music up and will have a good career.",""
"I miss playing the piano.",""
"We don't have one here and the only music I do is to join in with the weekly song-song.",""
"Don't you have a chance to get a loan from a charity?",""
"I know there's a lot of musticists working with the nursing homes.",""
"Don't you ever perform with musicians?",""
"Just the weekly song?",""
"I don't know about loans.",""
"A piano is a big thing though it would be good if there was a keyboard.",""
"I could have a tinkle in that.",""
"The sing-song.",""
"- dear me, that is a dreadful thing.",""
"Terrible songs and my terrible singing",""
"You're going to get addressed to the living council of the house.",""
"He could certainly put you in touch with a charity.",""
"Is it so bad the songs?",""
"What are they?",""
"From what era?",""
"I think I heard the bell for the evening meal.",""
"Will you stay for some food or do you have to leave now?",""
"We don't plan on staying for dinner and you know better than to call.",""
"I hope I can come back soon and we can arrange for me to stay for dinner with you.",""
"Thank you so much for coming to see me.",""
"it means so much to me to keep in touch.",""
"I hope you can come again soon.",""
"It was very nice to meet you, too.",""
"I'll be back.",""
"Maybe next week.",""
"These unfortunate ducks are very thin.",""
"Have you got bread to give?",""
"I have a few slices.",""
"It's been a hard winter for them and I don't think they've had very much to eat.",""
"They've started to build their nests, so they will need some fat on them for when they are sitting on eggs.",""
"Hey, you seem to know these brave ducks.",""
"Where did you learn all this?",""
"I'm a keen ornithologist.",""
"I spend weekends studying birds and looking for rare species.",""
"What are your hobbies?",""
"I see you're a specialist!",""
"I also like to walk around and listen to birds, but I don't know anything about it.",""
"What rare species are you looking for?",""
"Nightingales are quite rare.",""
"They sing beautifully.",""
"But when it comes to birdsong, I love the cheeky sound of the blackbird.",""
"I don't think you can beat waking up to the noisy sound of the birds.",""
"You've travelled in distant countries to see and listen to some very rare species?",""
"Yes, I was in Sri Lanka recently and saw some wonderful birds and animals.",""
"Have you travelled much?",""
"Yes, very much, especially in South America where there are extraordinary animals in the Amazon forest.",""
"Did you get a chance to get there?",""
"There's some amazing birds in Brazil.",""
"No, I would love to go to South America and particularly Brazil.",""
"It would be incredible to see a Toucan in the wild.",""
"I need to save up enough money to go there.",""
"Yes, a trip to South America costs enough.",""
"I'd like to go to Argentina and see the condors.",""
"I've heard that Argentina is a beautiful country too with stunning landscapes.",""
"It's a country I know very little about.",""
"I will have to do some research.",""
"We have to go south to Fire Nation.",""
"Chile too is a beautiful country.",""
"You'll find more animals there than those poor ducks!",""
"Hi, how are you?",""
"Hello, I am great thank you.",""
"How are you doing today?",""
"I'm fine.",""
"It's a good time to feed the ducks.",""
"Why is that?",""
"Because they are hungry",""
"They look hungry.",""
"What shall we give them to eat?",""
"I have heard that bread is not the best for them, what do you think?",""
"He was leaving that giving ducks bread is not good for them.",""
"Better give them carrots.",""
"Haha!",""
"The carrots might sink before they have a chance to eat them!",""
"It doesn't float carrots?",""
"If we reach out, maybe they'll come for lunch.",""
"At worst, they'll go down.",""
"Hopefully they won't sink while eating, that would be a sad lunchtime for them.",""
"Maybe we could try and stroke them?",""
"If we make duck noises they might come over!",""
"Shall we try?",""
"Yes!",""
"Let's try",""
"Corner little duck, come over here we have something to eat.",""
"Quack Quack",""
"Yes!",""
"He came over.",""
"He took the carrot from your hand!",""
"Let's just use it to stroke him before he leaves.",""
"Ah, too late.",""
"He got scared.",""
"All he left was feathers on the way out.",""
"Maybe he'll get caressed next time.",""
"We should go home.",""
"Good evening, my friend.",""
"How are you this evening?",""
"I've got terrible flatulence my friend.",""
"The food here is terrible!",""
"Oh, my poor old man.",""
"I brought you a bottle of wine, no one saw anything.",""
"Here, I'll hide it for you.",""
"Thanks but aren't you going to have some with me?",""
"It's up to you.",""
"You can keep it for yourself, we can drink from two, or we can also invite the nurse that I ran into the hallway when I came in.",""
"She's all right!",""
"Yes, it's fine.",""
"Most of the old folks in here don't know what day it is and wouldn't notice anyway!",""
"I know which nurse you mean - she gave me a nice massage earlier!",""
"Massage?",""
"Did you pay her for that, or do you think she likes you?",""
"Yes, the nurses gives us massages all the time.",""
"I get most of them though.",""
"The nurses seem to be queuing up!",""
"She wouldn't take any money from me.",""
"She says her services are free but I'm not sure what she means?",""
"Hmm, that's nice, but a little weird, isn't it?",""
"I mean, whatever!",""
"What matters is that there's a pretty nurse like that giving you massages.",""
"So, shall we open this bottle of wine?",""
"Yes, let's get it opened.",""
"I've got two nice wine glasses in my bedside cabinet.",""
"I've also got some playing cards here.",""
"Shall we invite one or two of the others and we can all play poker?",""
"That's a good idea.",""
"You want me to knock on doors, or do you have specific people in mind?",""
"Anybody, Just make sure you avoid door number 6.",""
"The lady in there is bonkers, and hurls abuse at everybody!",""
"All right, I'll look for people and I'll be right back!",""
"I'll be right back.",""
"I am worried about my mother.",""
"Tell me about your mother.",""
"Why are you worried about her?",""
"Well I am more worried about what she makes me do!",""
"Oh?",""
"What's she doing to you?",""
"I never seem to get any time on my own.",""
"She is always there.",""
"She tells you all the time what to do and how to do it?",""
"Well, no not really, but it's like she is watching me.",""
"And you feel like she's on trial?",""
"More like me being on trial.",""
"and I think she follows me...",""
"Is she following you?",""
"In town, everywhere?",""
"Not everywhere but yesterday I was in a coffee shop and I saw her at the door.",""
"When I looked up she was gone!",""
"Are you sure it was her?",""
"To be truthful...",""
"I am not sure anyone was there",""
"Who were you spying on?",""
"Why do you think I was spying?",""
"No, no, I was asking you who was spying on the door.",""
"It was a woman in a black coat carrying an umbrella",""
"She had long blonde hair tied in a bun.",""
"And your mother looks like that?",""
"sort off... it is like the photos of her as a young woman.",""
"But it probably wasn't her, then, was it?",""
"What did you have to do with your mother when you were a child?",""
"That's what I meant about not being sure anyone was there.",""
"I used to have a photo of her pinned on the wall next to my bed",""
"I used to cry a lot.",""
"I remember that",""
"Did she take care of you much?",""
"When she was at home yes, but I remember her being away from home a lot.",""
"Did you miss her when she was far away?",""
"Yes",""
"but I don't think she was that far away.",""
"Unfortunately, our time is up, it's time for my next patient.",""
"You'll be back next week, same time, same time?",""
"Thank you doctor",""
"yes I think my mother is waiting for me",""
"Good night",""
"Hey, you, did you just get in the neighborhood?",""
"This is the first time I've seen you, and you're at the regular table!",""
"Sorry.",""
"But I don't like being addressed as 'Hey, you.' How was I to know what table to sit at?",""
"I'll sit at the bar.",""
"If that's allowed?",""
"Oh, you've got character!",""
"Don't get upset!",""
"Can I get you something?",""
"Are you waiting for someone?",""
"I think we got off to a bad start.",""
"I'm not upset.",""
"Your tone seemed unwelcoming.",""
"I'll have a red wine and yes I'm waiting for a friend.",""
"Any more questions?",""
"I'm sorry I didn't want to rush you.",""
"I can offer you the wines of the days that are on the slate there.",""
"Is there a wine that is particularly local?",""
"You might be better off at the back table over there?",""
"It's kind of cozy, a little away from the rest of the customers.",""
"We only have local beer, wine comes from Bordeaux or the Coast of the Rhones.",""
"Ah I understand now.",""
"When you said regular table I thought I was sitting at another customer's regular table.",""
"Can I have a beer?",""
"Yes, you see, there are 12 and come every day at 2: 00.",""
"They are real drunks, I suggest you step away if your date is a little more...",""
"Sure, I'll bring the beer.",""
"OK.",""
"I see what you mean now.",""
"Thanks.",""
"Your friend doesn't seem to be here.",""
"Do you want me to keep you company?",""
"Oh that's very kind of you.",""
"She'll not be long.",""
"Let me introduce myself.",""
"My names Esther.",""
"What's yours?",""
"My name is Mathilde.",""
"Do you live around here?",""
"It's rare to see any new faces.",""
"Sorry got to go.",""
"See you tomorrow.",""
"Okay, I'll see you tomorrow!",""
"Good afternoon to you!",""
"Good morning, Maria!",""
"How are you?",""
"So so.",""
"The leg's playing up a bit.",""
"And the nurses keep disturbing me every time I nod off.",""
"You can never get any peace around here!",""
"It's true, they spend their time bothering us.",""
"She's moving objects in the rooms.",""
"She tells us to go here, do that, pfft.",""
"Who's that?",""
"I can't see very well anymore.",""
"Why is there a woman in my room?",""
"And you shouldn't be complaining!",""
"You get to stay at home and live you life, while I'm stuck in here.",""
"I was kidding!",""
"They're doing it for your own good.",""
"For my own good?!",""
"That's it, that's it!",""
"You've been talking about me behind my back.",""
"They've turned you against me, I know it!",""
"Come on, come on, you know I would never do that!",""
"Tell me about your day.",""
"What did you eat?",""
"I knew it!",""
"You have been talking to the nurses.",""
"They've been trying to get me to eat all day.",""
"Except I'm too smart for them.",""
"I know they're trying to poison me you see.",""
"So I've kept a little stash of sweets here under my pillow.",""
"That way I'll never starve.",""
"Stop talking nonsense, they would never do that.",""
"It's spring, how about a way out in the park?",""
"We could arrange this for a weekend of May.",""
"I'll ask Marcel, Jeannine and Leon if they want to come.",""
"I'm not friends with Jeannine anymore.",""
"She keeps stealing my crossword.",""
"And I'm sure she snogged Leon behind the medicine cupboard last Thursday.",""
"Too bad, we'll do it without them!",""
"Hello there",""
"Good evening.",""
"How are you?",""
"Very well thanks, and you?",""
"How do you think you are getting on with your Maths exam revision?",""
"I'm fine, thank you very much.",""
"I'm not sure, actually.",""
"I'm having a little trouble understanding the differential equations.",""
"Can you help me, please?",""
"Of course!",""
"What exactly are you struggling to get the hang of?",""
"Unfortunately, I didn't understand the last sentence, can you rephrase that?",""
"Of course - which concepts are you needing assistance with?",""
"Thank you.",""
